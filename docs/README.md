Users in the api are generally considered the base entity. Users participate in adding, deleting, updating.

###### Usernames

Amazing Facts enforces the following restrictions for usernames:
> 1. Names can contain most valid unicode characters. We limit some zero-width and non-rendering characters.
> 2. Usernames must be between 6 and 32 characters long.
> 3. Names are sanitized and trimmed of leading, trailing, and excessive internal whitespace.

The following restrictions are additionally enforced for usernames:
> 1. Names cannot contain the following substrings: '@', '#', ':', '```'.

There are other rules and restrictions not shared here, but the majority of users won't encounter them. It's important to properly handle all error messages returned by Amazing Facts Api when editing or updating names.
